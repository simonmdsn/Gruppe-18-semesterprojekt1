/*TODO:

1. Right now you can go back to a state you have completed and answer the questions again for more points. Needs to be fixed. We can't just deny this permission, it would lock you inside eventually.
2. Add the remaining states from the west. (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideas: 
1.When entering a state you have completed, display a message like "Welcome back to California, where do you want to go next?" Without having to complete the questions again.
2. We will have 11 states in total (Western US) and a total of 33 questions. My idea is that you have to gain at least 17 points in order to beat Trump, which is just above half of total
points you can achieve.
